1. Data Preparation:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset, including date conversion and feature engineering (e.g., extracting order month, year, and day of the week).



2. Monthly Sales and Profit Analysis:

Created line charts to visualize trends in monthly sales and profit.



3. Category and Sub-Category Analysis:

Analyzed sales and profit by category and sub-category using pie and bar charts.



4. Customer Segment Analysis:

Compared sales and profit across customer segments using bar charts and calculated the sales-to-profit ratio.



5. Tools and Libraries:

Python, Pandas, Plotly (Express and Graph Objects), and Plotly Colors for advanced visualizations.




This analysis provides actionable insights into category performance, sales trends, and customer segmentation to optimize business strategies
